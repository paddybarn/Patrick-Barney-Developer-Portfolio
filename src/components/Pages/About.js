        Hi, my name is Patrick Barney.  Patrick, like the starfish.  Barney, like the dinosaur.  It's like I was meant to create animated displays.  
        In a former life I worked in Marketing and Sales.  As well as most recently working as a travel ICU nurse.  My life experience is quite varied,
        but it has invariably brought me to web development.  Please sample some of my applications below.  I look forward to hearing from you!
